# 42-libasm-tester

This repository contains a tester for the **42-libasm** project, which you can use to test your implementation of **libasm**.

## Usage

Follow these steps to use the tester:

1. **Clone the 42-libasm-tester repository**:
   Clone the **42-libasm-tester** repository to your local machine:

   ```

2. **Copy the tester folder: Change into the 42-libasm-tester directory**:
    ```bash
    cp -r tester <path-to-42-libasm-project>
    ```

3. **Run the tester: Inside the tester directory of your 42-libasm project, run make**:
    ```bash
    cd <path-to-42-libasm-project>/tester
    make
    ```

## The tester will execute and show the results of various tests to check the functionality of your libasm implementation.
### A file named `log_erros.txt` will be generated with the test results.
